# Predicting-Net-Energy-Generation-of-Bangladesh-using-Machine-Learning-Models
Bangladesh government has an energy generation capacity of 21,000 MW but the energy  demand in mid-February 2022 was 9,000 MW. The demand is less than half of the overall  capacity. This situation is not new, for the last decade the government has paid a massive  Tk 60,000 crore as capacity payment penalty to the power producers for simply keeping  their plants idle. Thatâ€™s where Machine Learning comes into play. If I can predict how much  net energy generation is needed to fulfill the demand and occupy sufficient no of energy  producers, then the government will no longer have to pay for keeping their plants idle. I  have created a new split the dataset into 80% train data and 20% test data and then applied different Supervised Machine Learning models.
